# PhotoEnhancerUnblur

Generated from niche `photo-enhancer` (AI Image, tier A, score 77).

**Utility:** Upscale, sharpen and deblur photos
**Primary ASO keyword:** `photo enhancer`
**Also target:** `unblur photo`, `enhance photo`, `photo quality`, `upscale`
**Paywall hook:** 4K upscale, batch, no watermark

> Remini-genre. Universal need; strong impulse buy on first result.

## Build it

```bash
brew install xcodegen        # once
cd PhotoEnhancerUnblur
xcodegen generate
open PhotoEnhancerUnblur.xcodeproj
```

The app runs immediately on a MockPurchaseProvider (real paywall UI, fake
purchases). To go live:

1. Replace `revenueCatKey` in `Sources/App.swift` with your RevenueCat key.
2. In App Store Connect create products `photo-enhancer_yearly` and `photo-enhancer_weekly`,
   map them into a RevenueCat offering, entitlement id `premium`.
3. Build the real feature in `Sources/ContentView.swift`.
4. **Guideline 4.3:** make the function, UI, screenshots and keywords genuinely
   distinct from any sibling app. Re-niche, never reskin.

Bundle id: `com.zubeid.photoenhancer`

## Ship to TestFlight

This app ships with a Fastlane lane + GitHub Actions workflow. One-time account
setup (API key, signing) is documented in the kit's `Tools/appgen/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
Once your GitHub secrets are set, trigger the **TestFlight** workflow (or push a
`v*` tag), or run locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane beta
```
